# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This report aims to detail the differences in ride sharing data from PyBer by city type. Firstly, it will show how total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and rdiver, and total fare differ by city type. Then, we will create a line chart plotting total fares over the course of the first quarter of 2019 for PyBer to determine how the company can address the discrepancies between urban, suburban, and rural ride sharing fares.
